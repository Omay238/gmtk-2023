# Game ideas
Theme: Roles Reversed

 - Puzzle game, but you control the puzzle, not the player
    - Open doors
    - Drop elements
 - Second person game
   - One player
   - See from AI's point of view
   - Maybe a shooter?
 - Game Dev simulator
   - Break the 4th wall
   - Fix bugs
   - Play both roles?
   - Seems good to me. I'll prototype it now.
