# Game ideas
Theme: Roles Reversed

Idea: A game where you play as the developer, and have to fix bugs in your game.

Bugs:
- Player can't move
  - Movement code is commented out
- End of level doesn't end level
  - `level = 1` instead of `level += 1`
- Player sprite has wrong path
  - `err.png` instead of `player.png`
- Players jump is too short
- Enemy doesn't kill player
- Level is broken
  - Some parts have typos
- Level uses wrong texture
- todo: add more errors
